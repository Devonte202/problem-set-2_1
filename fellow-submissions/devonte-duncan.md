# Problem Set 2.1
## Types, Values, and Operators

1. What is _unary operator_? Give an example of one.

  A unary operator like any operator performs an operation on only one argument or operand. One example is the ++ operator which adds one to its operand.

2. What is a _binary operator_? Give an example of one.

  A binary operator is an operator that operates on two operands. For example the `+` or `-` operators for math, they require a number on the left and right of them to operate. 

3. When do we use the _ternary operator_? Use a code snippet to illustrate below?

  We use a ternary operator as a shorthand for simple if else statements. Here's an example:
  
  let falseByDefault = true;
  falseByDefault ? console.log('This is what this code alone would output.') : console.log('This code would not run as the variable declare is abstractly equal to the binary value of true.');

4. What is the difference between using the _strict_ and _non-strict_ equality operators?

  The strict equality operator '(===)', compares its two operands to see if they're equal in type and in content. Meanwhile the non-strict equality operator '(==)', coerces both operands to be the same type then compares to see if they're equal in content.

5. What are the seven JavaScript data types? Which of these are considered _primitive_?

  The seven JavaScript data types are:
   - strings //Primitive
   - numbers  //Primitive
   - null  //Primitive
   - undefined  //Primitive
   - boolean  //Primitive
   - symbols // Primitive
   - objects

6. What does the code below return?
  ```javascript
  typeof 'i love marcy lab';
  ```
  This code will return 'string'.

7. What does the code below return?
  ```javascript
  typeof true;
  ```
  This code will return 'boolean'.

8. What does the code below return?
  ```javascript
  typeof (10**9);
  ```
  This code will return 'number'.

9. What does the following code return? Why?
  ```javascript
  typeof null;
  ```
   This code will return 'object'. This is because null is considered an object devoid of data by javascript.

10. What does it mean to be _truthy_ or _falsy_? What six values are _falsy_?

   Truthy and falsy are the inherent boolean values of things in JavaScript. A truthy type always evaluates to true. While a falsy type always evaluates to false.
   
   Here are the six falsy values:
   - null
   - '' (empty string)
   - undefined
   - 0
   - NaN
   - false
   

11. Evaluate the following expressions using JavaScripts implicit coercion rules. Then, in one sentence, explain what coercions were applied and why:

  * `8 * null` = 0  [null is coerced to be 0 because the rule is when an arithmetic operator is used both operands will be coerced to be numbers.]
  * `"5" - 1` = "51" [1 is coerced to be a string because the rule is when an arithmetic operator is used when one of the operands is a string, both operands are just concatenated.]
  * `"5" + 1` = 4 [5 is coerced to be 0 because the rule is when an arithmetic operator is used both operands will be coerced to be numbers.]
  * `true + false` = 1 [True is coerced to be 1 and False is coerced to be 0 because the rule is when an arithmetic operator is used both operands will be coerced to be numbers.]
  * `"i am" + undefined` = i amundefined [i am is a string that isn't abstractly a number so "undefined" is coerced into being a string.]
  * `5 + undefined` = NaN [undefined has no numerable value and 5 is number, so naturally the addition of these two things is not a number (NaN).]

12. What will each line of the following code return?
   ```javascript
   (false && undefined);
   ```
   false

   ```javascript
   (false || undefined);
   ```
    undefined

   ```javascript
   ((false && undefined) || (false || undefined));
   ```
    undefined
    
   ```javascript
   ((false || undefined) || (false && undefined));
   ```
    false

   ```javascript
   ((false && undefined) && (false || undefined));
   ```
    false
   
   ```javascript
   ((false || undefined) && (false && undefined));
   ```
    undefined
   
   ```javascript
   ('a' || (false && undefined) || '');
   ```
    'a'
   
   ```javascript
   ((false && undefined) || 'a' || '');
   ```
     'a'
     
   ```javascript
   ('a' && (false || undefined) && '');
   ```
     undefined

   ```javascript
   ((false || undefined) && 'a' && '');
   ```
     undefined
